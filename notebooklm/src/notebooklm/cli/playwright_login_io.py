"""Command-layer IO seam + wrappers for the Playwright login flow (#1391).

:mod:`notebooklm.cli.services.playwright_login` is a pure service: it owns the
browser-automation logic but no longer imports the command layer's
presentation (``..rendering``), exit-policy (``..error_handler``), or
async-runner (``..runtime``) modules. This module sits on the *command* side of
the ADR-0008 boundary and supplies the concrete sink the service's
``LoginIO`` Protocol describes, plus the thin orchestration wrappers that drive
the service from ``session_cmd``:

* :class:`PlaywrightLoginIO` (+ :func:`make_login_io`) — the concrete
  ``console.print`` / ``exit_with_code`` / ``run_async`` sink.
* :func:`validate_flags_or_exit` — render-and-exit wrapper over
  ``validate_login_flag_conflicts`` (which now returns a typed ``Conflict``).
* :func:`prepare_paths_or_exit` — render-and-exit wrapper over
  ``prepare_login_paths`` (which now returns a typed
  ``PreparedPaths | PathError``); preserves the legacy
  ``(storage_path, browser_profile)`` 2-tuple contract.
* :func:`run_login` — drives ``run_playwright_login`` with the concrete sink.
* :func:`repair_after_refresh` — drives ``repair_playwright_account_metadata``
  with the concrete sink (used by the file-backed ``auth refresh`` keepalive).

Keeping the sink + wrappers here (not in ``session_cmd``) lets the command
module collapse its five Playwright import blocks into one and keeps the
orchestration that the service shed from re-inflating the handler.
