# Apple Notes CLI

## Preflight Checks
Before executing any `memo` commands, you MUST perform the following checks:
1. **OS Check**: Run `uname -s`. If the output is not `Darwin`, immediately abort and inform the user that this skill only supports macOS.
2. **Dependency Check**: Run `command -v memo`. If not found, surface the situation to the user with the install command (`brew tap antoniorodr/memo && brew install antoniorodr/memo/memo`). Do NOT install without explicit user authorization — but if the user authorizes it, the AI MAY run the brew command itself rather than asking the user to do it manually.
3. **Permission Check**: Before the first read/write operation, ensure Automation permissions are granted. If any command returns a `-1743` or Automation error, guide the user to: `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation` to grant terminal access to Notes.app.

## Tool Call Policy
- **No Hallucination**: All read, search, and list operations MUST rely solely on the actual output of the `memo` CLI. Do not fabricate or guess note contents.
- **Error Handling**: If a tool call fails (non-zero exit code, non-empty stderr, or platform `invoke_model_error`), you MUST honestly report the failure reason to the user and suggest a retry. Do not generate fake data to cover up the error.
- **Write Verification**: After any write, modify, delete, or move operation, you MUST verify the result by running `memo notes -s "<query>"` or the corresponding list command.

## Editing & Format Safety
- **Backup First**: Before editing an existing note, you MUST read its full original HTML body and inform the user that the original content has been backed up in the context.
- **Full HTML Replacement**: DO NOT use character id range splicing to modify rich text. You must use full HTML replacement to avoid corrupting the note's structure.
- **Preserve Styles**: When appending or modifying content, ensure original HTML/CSS style tags are preserved.
- **Complex Notes**: For notes with complex formatting, strongly suggest creating a new note instead of modifying the existing one in place.

Use `memo notes` to manage Apple Notes directly from the terminal. Create, view, edit, delete, search, move notes between folders, and export to HTML/Markdown.

Setup
- Install (Homebrew): `brew tap antoniorodr/memo && brew install antoniorodr/memo/memo`
- Manual (pip): `pip install .` (after cloning the repo)
- macOS-only; if prompted, grant Automation access to Notes.app.

View Notes
- List all notes: `memo notes`
- Filter by folder: `memo notes -f "Folder Name"`
- Search notes (fuzzy): `memo notes -s "query"`

Create Notes
- Add a new note: `memo notes -a`
  - Opens an interactive editor to compose the note.
- **Note**: `memo notes -a` is **interactive only** and does NOT accept a title as a positional argument (`Got unexpected extra argument` error). If the user asks for a note with a specific title and/or body, **use `osascript` directly** instead of `memo` — see "Direct AppleScript" below.

Direct AppleScript (preferred for non-interactive creation with title/body)
- Create a note with a given title and empty body:
  ```bash
  osascript -e 'tell application "Notes" to tell default account to make new note with properties {name:"<title>", body:""}'
  ```
  Returns the new note's id (e.g. `x-coredata://.../ICNote/p1343`).
- Create with body (use `\n` for line breaks inside the `body:"..."` string):
  ```bash
  osascript -e 'tell application "Notes" to tell default account to make new note with properties {name:"<title>", body:"line1\nline2"}'
  ```
- Verify: `osascript -e 'tell application "Notes" to get name of every note of default account whose name contains "<title>"'`
- First call to Notes.app will trigger a system permission prompt (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation); user must approve.

Edit Notes
- Edit existing note: `memo notes -e`
  - Interactive selection of note to edit.

Delete Notes
- Delete a note: `memo notes -d`
  - Interactive selection of note to delete.

Move Notes
- Move note to folder: `memo notes -m`
  - Interactive selection of note and destination folder.

Export Notes
- Export to HTML/Markdown: `memo notes -ex`
  - Exports selected note; uses Mistune for markdown processing.

Limitations
- Cannot edit notes containing images or attachments.
- Interactive prompts may require terminal access.
- Apple Notes does not natively render Markdown; rich text editing requires full HTML replacement.

Notes
- macOS-only.
- Requires Apple Notes.app to be accessible.
- For automation, grant permissions in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation.
